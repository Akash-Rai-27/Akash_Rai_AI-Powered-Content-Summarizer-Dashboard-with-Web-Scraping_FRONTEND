# AI-Powered Content Summarizer Dashboard with Web Scraping features

This project is an 
AI-powered content summarizer with web scraping capabilities. It allows users to scrape any website by simply entering the URL, edit the response, paste or write content, and let the AI summarize it to the desired length. The summary can be downloaded in various formats (.pdf, .txt, .json, .csv).

The project emphasizes functionality, component reusability, and maintaining a single source of truth using Redux Toolkit. It features a clean, industry-standard development structure and a user-friendly, responsive interface. The design approach is detailed at the end of this document.

>I have used Abstractâ€™s Web Scraping API for website scraping, it has few limited free requests !! 

> ** Important!** Landscape mode in phones is not handled in resonsiveness

## Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to get the development environment running in you system.

### initial setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd your-repository

# Install dependencies
npm install
```
### Steps to run
1. You need to create an account and project on appwrite to store the data and for user authentication and authorization.

2. Create an .env file in repo root directory

```javascript
VITE_APPWRITE_URL = "" //(endpoint)
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID = ""
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID = ""
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID = ""
VITE_ABSTRACTION_API_KEY = ""
```
3. Create an folder inside src named conf and then create a file inside conf.js and write these values to import clean
```javascript
const conf = {

    appwriteUrl : String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_URL),

    appwriteProjectId : String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID),

    appwriteDatabaseId : String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID),

    appwriteCollectionId : String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID),

    abstractApiKey : String(import.meta.env.VITE_ABSTRACTION_API_KEY)

}

export default conf
```

``` bash 
# now run the project
npm run dev
```
4. Create an account - Signup or Login to access
5. After than you land on dashboard
